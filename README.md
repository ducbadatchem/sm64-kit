# sm64-kit

A kit compiled by ducbadatchem to be a one-stop shop for SM64 binary hacking related software. 

## Very useful links:
Please read them, as they are practically introductions and guides to hacking.

## Kit contents:
### Programs and tools
Tools that are used in making binary hacks
- Quad64 (v0.3) by DavidSM64 and aglab2: a tool to edit objects in SM64 levels
- SM64 ROM Manager (v1.14.16)- a multipurpose tool which includes level-editing, text-editing, music-import, and more.
- Parallel Lakitu Patcher (good version) - Add aglab2's famous Parallel Lakitu Camera to your hack. 
- SM64 Text Manager (v2.7) - Used in cases where ROM Manager's text editing doesn't work (e.g. editor hacks)
- Simple ARMips GUI (v1.3.2) - Used to apply ASM tweaks into ROMs. 
- Flips (v1.31?) - Create `.bps` patches for sharing.
- Hacktice (v1.6) - Used for testing and/or speedrunning.

These programs are tested on Windows 10, 11 and Linux Mint v21.3 with `wine 6.0.3` by me.
=> Result: ROM Manager crashes instantly when it boots up on Mint + Wine, other programs work fine, your millage may vary however. 

Other Programs:
- Bowser's Blueprint by falcobuster: will comment more if I actually know how this works :Kappa:
### Tweaks 
Tweaks are usually used to enhance or change the hack experience, and they are somewhat similar to cheat codes in this regard.
- FrostyZako's ASM and Tweak Collection - Very good tweaks in general, but note that multiple tweaks are included per file, so please extract them accordingly.
- PyroJay's ROM Manager Tweak Collection - Tweaks that are (intended?) to be applied via ROM Manager, but can be applied without.
- ducbadatchem's Tweaks (WIP) - Tweaks that are made by me for various reasons, feel free to use. 

Have Fun Hacking!
